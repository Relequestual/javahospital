package pathFinding;

/**
 * A tagging interface for an object representing the entity in the game that is
 * going to moving along the path. This allows us to pass around entity/state
 * information to determine whether a particular tile is blocked, or how much
 * cost to apply on a particular tile.
 * 
 * For instance, a Mover might represent a tank or plane on a game map. Passing
 * round this entity allows us to determine whether rough ground on a map should
 * effect the unit's cost for moving through the tile.
